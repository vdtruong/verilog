This project uses the Xilinx Ace Player to program the bit file into the flash prom using the .ace format.  The ace player vhdl code
was converted to verilog and all the necessary glue logic was written to perform the transfer.  The ace file was successfully 
implemented using the 1 MHz serial uart transfer.
