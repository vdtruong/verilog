5-31-2018  The verilog source code for this project is for the Simplified SD Card Specification.  Only the necessary codes are
implemented to make the card funtional for the on going project at the time.  

Basically, the card needs to store 1024 words every 0.5 second.  Each word is 36 bits.  Every 0.5 second, the IO fpga will fetch 256 words
from the UI, Control, Safety and itself to store in the sd card.  The information is the memory map registers of these fpgas.  The data
will be used for troubleshooting.  To make 1024 words to fit into the sd card sector architecture, we will need to send 16 blocks every
0.5 second.  For the sd card, each block is 512 bytes.

At this time, only 15 blocks are sucessfully sent.  I think the last block does not have the CRC included, that is why the sd card does not
write it to memory.  I will need a chipscope license to troubleshoot this last issue.

This repository includes the source codes for the sd card and other codes to make it work for the board it was used on.  You can download
the Simplified Specification at https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/.  This code uses both the physical layer and host controller 
simplified specification.
